# Expo CLI: Incompatibility Issue Leading to Unexpected Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet often perplexing issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: unexpected errors arising from version mismatches between the Expo SDK, the Expo CLI, and the features used within your application.

## Problem Description

The primary source of these errors lies in attempting to utilize functionalities or modules within your React Native application that aren't supported by the presently configured Expo SDK version. This often results in runtime errors or build failures.  The errors might not always be obvious, making diagnosis challenging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3. Install the project dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Attempt to run the application using `expo start`.

You'll likely observe an error related to SDK compatibility. The specific error will vary based on the exact incompatibility.

## Solution

The solution involves aligning your application's dependencies with a compatible Expo SDK version.  This may involve:

* **Updating your Expo SDK:** Check the Expo documentation to ensure you're using the latest stable version or a version that explicitly supports the features used in your application. You can update the SDK version by following the instructions in the official Expo documentation. This often requires updating the `expo.json` file.
* **Downgrading features:** If updating the SDK isn't immediately feasible, consider temporarily removing or downgrading features that aren't compatible with your current SDK version. 
* **Using a polyfill:** For certain functionalities, you might be able to use a polyfill to provide compatibility between older SDK versions and newer features.
