This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module in your Expo project that isn't compatible with the version of Expo CLI you're using.  For instance, you might be using a newer React Native feature that requires a newer Expo SDK version.

Here's an example of code that might trigger this (assuming you're using a feature not supported by your Expo SDK):
```javascript
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser'; //Might cause error if SDK version is too old

WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync('https://www.example.com');
```
